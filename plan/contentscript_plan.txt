Types of containers that need an initial cleaning and a MutationObserver:
- video-container			(e.g. the recommendation section on youtube.com/watch?*)
- channel-container			(e.g. the channels displayed on the home page)
- comment-container			(e.g. the comment section displayed on youtube.com/watch?*)
- comment-reply-container 	(e.g. the reply section displayed in a comment section on youtube.com/watch?*)

Also a message-listener is needed which listens to messages from the controller(backgroundscript).

__Strategies__
strategy #1:
- attaching different sets of scripts to different kind of yt pages
pros: 
	- abstraction possible
cons:
	- functionality needed for identification of different kind of yt pages
		- attaching scripts from background scripts
			- what happens on transition?
		- attaching scripts from one content script which is attached to all yt pages
			- what happens on transition?
	- knowledge of transitions between different kind of yt pages is needed*
	- reattaching of possibly other set of content scripts is needed on transition

strategy #2:
- attaching same set of scripts to all kind of yt pages
- content scripts will always try to do everything
pros:
	- abstraction possible
cons:
	- knowledge of transitions between different kind of yt pages is needed*
	- refreshing content scripts on transition is needed
	
*can be provided via 
	- heuristics (page analysis)
	- browser.tabs.onUpdated and listen to url changes of relevant tabs
